    <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>My website is about how to stay true to your wild side and filled with so much juicy life. I will provide resources that I have used and inspire me that will hopefully resonate with you. My goal is for this website to be fun and relatable, while not being super spiritual and "woo woo". The resources in here are meant to make you think in a different way and just get you excited about LIFE!!!! Wherever you are at, you have the power to create the life of your dreams!</p>
