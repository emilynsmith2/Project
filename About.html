                I'm Emily and I wanted to share some resources that will help you live a wild juicy life aka a life of higher consciousness! Living in higher consciousness is about seeing your life from a higher perspective and always continuing to learn and grow. When you are able to constantly raise your consciousness to higher dimensions you can begin to feel that "out of body" high. In our society, we associate emotions, reactions, impulses, etc. to who we are, but that is not who we are. You are not your reaction to situations, you are not your emotions, you are not your impulses. Those are parts that you have taken on. You take on these parts when fear is triggered. </p>
                <p>There are two principles that have helped me make sense of things: 1. we are all on this planet figuring out life out together 2. The universe operates based on vibrations and frequencies and we are all made up of these frequencies. So we are in the unvierse and the unvierse is in us...<p>It's like in Christianity when the Priest says that God is inside all of us, same concept. </p>
                When we recognzie that our world operates based on frequencies and vibrations we can see how connected we are to everything #highvibezzbruhhh. But this saying has true meaning. You know when someone is high vibes vs. low vibes. WildJuicyLife.com is here to make you an even higher vibration and give you resources to step into a new dimension and start seeing your life from a different view. </p>
                <p>
                
                The saying "Stay Wild Stay Juicy" refers back to the time when we were wild creatures co-living with nature, yet now we create barriers and are unattached from our wild side, our true essence. When this happens we become unaligned and unbalanced, in this unbalanced state is when disease {dis-ease} manifests. This is where my journey to consciousness began. It began with witnessing disease and asking why...Now I want to share with other people how I have been able to transform my thoughts from "Everyting is happening TO me" ---> "Everything is happening FOR me" </p>
                <p>Always remember <span>~STAY WILD STAY JUICY~</span></p>
