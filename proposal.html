    <div>
        <h2><span class="h2">WHAT</span></h2>
        <p> My website is about how to stay true to your wild side and filled with so much juicy life. I will provide
            resources that I have used
            that will hopefully resonate with other people. I want to make it fun and relatable, while not being super
            spiritual and "woo woo"</p>
        <br>
        <h2><span class="h2">OBJECTIVE</span></h2>
        <p>The objective of my website is to get people thinking in a higher state of mind, to get them out of their
            small minds and into the vortex! This will help inspire people to live their lives to the fullest</p>
        <br>
        <h2><span class="h2">AUDIENCE</span></h2>
        <p>My target audience is the type of person who has opened their heart to new possibilities. This person can be
            of any age, it just depends how open the person is to learning and receiving this new way of thinking. This
            could be someone who is just starting their soul journey, or someone who needs a reminder. Overall the
            target audience is made up of people who do not take themselves too seriously but want to leave the Earth
            better than when they entered it! </p>
